# tabSorter

My first chrome extension. The goal is to transition into being a full fledged tab/bookmark manager.

## Features

- [x] Sort tabs by age

- [x] Merge windows

## Next features

- Automatically sort based on user-defined sort order
- Extract domain
- List tabs

## Future features

- Bookmarks stacks, think OneTab
- Vertical tab-layout
  - Drag and drop sort
  - Search tabs (url, title)
  - Close tabs
  - Windows-like selection (ctrl, shift)
  - Easy window management
- _Synchronize open tabs on different devices_
- __Bookmark features__
- Open tab groups to pin
- Keyboard shortcuts
  - Toggle pin tab
  - Duplicate tab (open in background)
  - ...
- _Launchy/Vimium like interface_

### Planned non-functionality

- Extension icon
- Icon/images for buttons for faster recognition
- Try popular tools (in branches)
